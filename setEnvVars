# Environment variables to make it easier to use the instructions for working with AWS CLI.
# Most values of the environment variable in this file can be modified;
# exceptions that should not be modified because they are computed values are clearly marked.

# Do not change this computed value:
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="$( aws sts get-caller-identity | jq -r .UserId )"

# Modify the value to reference another AWS region if you like, for example us-east-1:
AWS_REGION="$( aws configure get region )"


# Directory where the Lambda function resides.
# If you change this value you will need to adjust some of the instructions and accompanying scripts.
AWS_LAMBDA_DIR=lambda

# Name of the Lambda function you wish to invoke, change this to any valid Lambda name.
# (See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_CreateFunction.html#API_CreateFunction_RequestParameters):
AWS_LAMBDA_NAME=BackendLambda

# Name of the zip file containing the Lambda function, change to any value you like:
AWS_LAMBDA_ZIP=function.zip

# Runtime of the Lambda function, change to suit:
# (See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html)
AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME=python3.8

# Lambda entry point (AWS documentation calls this a handler).
# The first portion of the value is the name of the Python source code in the zip filecontaining the handler,
# and the second portion of the value is the name of the handler function in that file.
# For example, if the Python source code file is called echo.py and the handler is called handler, the value would be:
AWS_LAMBDA_HANDLER=echo.lambda_handler

# Do not change this next line; the value is obtained from AWS when the role is created using the extract script:
AWS_ROLE_ARN="arn:aws:iam::$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:role/lambda-ex"

# Do not change this next line; the value is computed:
AWS_LAMBDA_ARN="arn:aws:lambda:$AWS_REGION:$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:function:$AWS_LAMBDA_NAME"

## Give your API Gateway API any name you like:
AWS_APIG_NAME=LambdaHTTP

## This will be given a value as you type along with the page
## https://github.com/mslinn/awsLambdaTest/blob/master/HTTP_API.md#create-an-api-gateway-http-api
AWS_APIG_HTTP_ID=y5sy8ty98g

AWS_HTTP_INVOCATION_URL=https://$AWS_APIG_HTTP_ID.execute-api.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$AWS_APIG_PATH_PART/


# Discussed in REST_API.md; provide any values you desire:
AWS_REST_NAME=LambdaREST
